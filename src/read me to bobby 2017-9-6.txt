hi, in 2017-9-6, I've tried to deploy these two project to tomcat and it works.
When next time I go to your home, I can configure it. The debug behavior is not changed, I suppose my change will not block your coding


From code perspective, you just need to items below:
1) I've changed the context to "computer" and "mobile", while web.xml doesn't change.
   So for desktop version, the url will change to something like computer/api/sales.
      for mobile version, the url will change to something like mobile/api/products.
   If you would like to debug, you just need to keep one server avaiable and use eclipse to debug.(debug behavior doesn't change)

2) I've changed several reference in project. But you don't need to extra changes.

3) I've changed tomecat version, you need to some update to your computer.
   You could find "apache-tomcat-7.0.79.rar" in your src folder, you need to copy this file to C:\, then decompress this file.
   You don't need to config this server if you just want to debug with Eclipse.
